## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I started out with structuring my html, after whichh I got to styling.
I made a mistake in my styling, I gave a div a class name of "body" and was styling the body element in my style instead of the class. I figured something was wrong when my work was not responsive in mobile view and had to retrace my steps
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned that responsiveness is about paying close attention to details. 
I usually like using display-flex, justify-content-center and align-items-center to center my work but that usually required a widtha nd height which could affect responsive behaviour. I stuck with margin-auto for x axis and a percentage like 6% for y axis
display: flex;


```html
 <div class="body"> </div>
```
```css
.body {
	/* width: 100%; */
	width: 70%;
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	margin: 7% auto;
	padding: 0rem 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development
I want to start focusing on working with grid, rather than flex

## Acknowledgments
I worked on this all by myself but would not have made it without the help of a few friends and online resources in previous projects
